# My Portfolio - Kitana Kearney
## Description 
I created this webpage to act as an online portfolio that presents information about my career and background, and showcases some of the projects I will have created by the end of this program. The website also includes my resume and my contact information for any employeers interested in hiring me. This project was also very helpful as it improved my understanding of how flex properties work and are displayed.

## Usage
In the header of the top of the page, when the user clicks on a navagation list link, it will take the user to the selected section within the page. To view the individual projects of the work section in a seperate woebpage, the user has to hover on and then click the labeled picture to be taken to the deployed website.
